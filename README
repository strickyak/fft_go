FFT code. 

My own attempt at FFT does not totally work;
code from github.com/mjibson/go-dsp/fft does.

// Maybe I should have written a BASIC interpreter instead,
// and used the Professor's code :)

go run waterfall.go --n=256:

   Input is a text file with integer voltage samples,
   in a typical decoded mulaw scale, max about +-30000.

   Output is a PPM textfile of the waterfall.
   Use "ppmtojpeg" or "ppmtogif" etc. to produce an image.
   It's upside down -- time goes down, unlike most waterfalls.

go run render.go

   Quick test code.
